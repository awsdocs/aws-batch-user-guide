# Creating a single\-node job definition<a name="create-job-definition"></a>

Before you can run jobs in AWS Batch, you must create a job definition\. This process varies slightly for single\-node and multi\-node parallel jobs\. This topic covers creating a job definition for an AWS Batch job that's not a multi\-node parallel job\.

To create a multi\-node parallel job definition, see [Creating a multi\-node parallel job definition](multi-node-job-def.md)\. For more information about multi\-node parallel jobs, see [Multi\-node Parallel Jobs](multi-node-parallel-jobs.md)\.
