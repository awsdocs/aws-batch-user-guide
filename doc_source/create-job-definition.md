# Creating a single\-node job definition<a name="create-job-definition"></a>

Before you can run jobs in AWS Batch, you must create a job definition\. This process varies slightly between single\-node and multi\-node parallel jobs\. This topic covers specifically how to create a job definition for an AWS Batch job that's not a multi\-node parallel job\.

You can create a multi\-node parallel job definition on Amazon Elastic Container Service resources\. For more information, see [Creating a multi\-node parallel job definition](create-multi-node-job-def.md)\.
