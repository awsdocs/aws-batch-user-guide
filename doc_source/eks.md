AWS Batch simplifies execution of batch workloads on Amazon EKS clusters by providing managed batch capabilities such as queuing, dependency tracking, managing job retries and priorities, pod management, and node scaling\. AWS Batch is designed to handle multiple Availability Zones, multiple Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes, and integrates with Amazon EC2 Spot best practices to run your workloads in a fault\-tolerant manner with low interruption rates\. You can use AWS Batch to run a handful of overnight jobs, or millions of mission\-critical jobs, with confidence that AWS Batch helps you manage them with speed and efficiency\.

AWS Batch is a managed service that orchestrates batch workloads in your Kubernetes clusters managed by Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\)\. AWS Batch conducts this orchestration external to your clusters using an “overlay” model\. Since AWS Batch is a managed service, there are no Kubernetes components \(for example, Operators or Custom Resources\) to install or manage in your cluster\. AWS Batch only needs your cluster to be configured with Role\-Based Access Controls \(RBAC\) that allow AWS Batch to communicate with the Kubernetes API server\. AWS Batch calls Kubernetes APIs to create, monitor, and delete Kubernetes pods and nodes\.

AWS Batch has built\-in scaling logic to automatically scale Kubernetes nodes based on job queue load, working diligently to optimize capacity allocations for jobs\. When the job queue is empty, AWS Batch will scale down the nodes to the minimum capacity you set, by default zero\. AWS Batch manages the full lifecycle of these nodes, and decorates the nodes with labels and taints so other Kubernetes workloads aren't placed on the nodes managed by AWS Batch\. The exception to this are `DaemonSets`, which can target AWS Batch nodes to provide monitoring and other functionality required for proper execution of the jobs\. Additionally, AWS Batch doesn't run jobs \(that is pods\) on nodes in your cluster that it doesn't manage, allowing you to leverage separate scaling logic and services for other applications on the cluster\.

To submit jobs to AWS Batch, you interact directly with the AWS Batch API\. AWS Batch translates jobs into `podspecs` and then creates the requests to place pods on nodes managed by AWS Batch in your EKS cluster\. You can use tools like `kubectl` to view running pods and nodes as normal\. When a pod has completed its execution, AWS Batch deletes the pod it created to maintain a lower load on the Kubernetes system\.

You can get started by connecting a valid Amazon EKS cluster with AWS Batch, attaching an AWS Batch job queue to it, and registering an EKS job definition using `podspec` equivalent attributes\. Then submit jobs using the [SubmitJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_SubmitJob.html) API operation, referencing to the job definition\.
