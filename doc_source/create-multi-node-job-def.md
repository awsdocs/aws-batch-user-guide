# Creating a multi\-node parallel job definition<a name="create-multi-node-job-def"></a>

Before you can run jobs in AWS Batch, you must create a job definition\. This process varies slightly between single\-node and multi\-node parallel jobs\. This topic covers specifically how to create a job definition for an AWS Batch multi\-node parallel job\. For more information, see [Multi\-node parallel jobs](multi-node-parallel-jobs.md)\. 

**Note**  
AWS Fargate doesn't support multi\-node parallel jobs\.
