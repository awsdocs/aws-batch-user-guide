# Job queues<a name="job_queues"></a>

Jobs are submitted to a job queue where they reside until they can be scheduled to run in a compute environment\. An AWS account can have multiple job queues\. For example, you can create a queue that uses Amazon EC2 On\-Demand instances for high priority jobs and another queue that uses Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for low\-priority jobs\. Job queues have a priority that's used by the scheduler to determine which jobs in which queue should be evaluated for execution first\.
