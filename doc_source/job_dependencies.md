# Job dependencies<a name="job_dependencies"></a>

When you submit an AWS Batch job, you can specify the job IDs that the job depends on\. When you do so, the AWS Batch scheduler ensures that your job is run only after the specified dependencies have successfully completed\. After they succeed, the dependent job transitions from `PENDING` to `RUNNABLE` and then to `STARTING` and `RUNNING`\. If any of the job dependencies fail, the dependent job automatically transitions from `PENDING` to `FAILED`\.

For example, Job A can express a dependency on up to 20 other jobs that must succeed before it can run\. You can then submit additional jobs that have a dependency on Job A and up to 19 other jobs\.

For array jobs, you can specify a `SEQUENTIAL` type dependency without specifying a job ID so that each child array job completes sequentially, starting at index 0\. You can also specify an `N_TO_N` type dependency with a job ID\. That way, each index child of this job must wait for the corresponding index child of each dependency to complete before it can begin\. For more information, see [Array jobs](array_jobs.md)\.

To submit an AWS Batch job with dependencies, see [Submitting a job](submit_job.md)\.
